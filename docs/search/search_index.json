I designed it like a small booklet and gave each student a printed copy at the start of their first independent project. It served as a checklist of sorts to guide them through the unstructured task of making a map\u2014on any theme, in any place, for any time and audience of their choosing\u2014and to make all of these decisions independently.</p> <p>The checklist showed the influence of those who had taught me over the years. The title echoed a question Waldo Tobler asked every graduate student at our proposal defense: \u201cHow will you know when you are done?\u201d The structure drew from Christopher Alexander\u2019s A Pattern Language and its core idea that good design solves a series of timeless conflicts confronting every designer in a domain. The purpose pointed to Donald Sch\u00f6n\u2019s call, in The Reflective Practitioner, that design thinking involves knowing how to set up a problem as well as how to solve it.</p> <p>Despite its intentions, the checklist didn\u2019t land well with everyone. Perhaps overly sensitive, I listened to a few anonymous voices\u2014on course response forms and public-facing websites\u2014who found it stressful, excessive, tedious, or complicating. So after a few years, I stopped handing it out.</p> <p>Then, a couple of years ago, a former student contacted me. They were in a job, faced with a graphic design task, and wrote to ask if I still had the handout\u2014and if so, whether I could send them a copy. I dug it up, saw all the things I would now change, but sent it as it was. A few months later, a second student wrote with a similar request. When a third reached out, I realized there might still be value in the old project\u2014and that it might be worth developing a version that could live online.</p> <p>This site aims to revive the old handout and build on it. It\u2019s a work in progress, something I tinker with whenever I teach cartography at Middlebury. It\u2019s imperfect and incomplete, but perhaps it still holds value. It reflects my three core beliefs about mapmaking:</p> <ol> <li>Everything on a map (and everything left off) reflects a decision by the mapmaker.  </li> <li>The mapmaker must be able to articulate one or more reasons for every decision.  </li> <li>\u201cI just liked it\u201d should never be the only reason.</li> </ol> <p>Jeff Howarth Associate Professor, Geography Department, Middlebury College, USA  </p> <p>Last update: 04/16/2025</p> <p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 4.0 International License.</p>"},{"location":"narratives/green-space/","title":"green space maps","text":"<p>Green space maps originate from efforts to distinguish public and private space, such as the influential map of Rome by Giambattista Nolli.

For the cartographer, the recurring problem is to find a solution that allows the reader to see where the political or parcel line follows a natural boundary and when it follows a more abritrary path.  </p> <p>Many cartographers solve this with a system of pecked lines, variations of dash-gap-dot-gap, that allow the reader to see where the political or property line overlaps an underlying line, like a river. In this solution, the cartographer places the line with the Morse code over the river line. There are other solutions to the problem that do not employ pecking systems. For example, some cartographers draw the political or parcel stroke with a lighter value and greater weight and place this under the river line.

Using some sort of area fill for the territory will conflict with these interior features.

Often, the solution is to cut and remove the political or property line where it follows the coast.
